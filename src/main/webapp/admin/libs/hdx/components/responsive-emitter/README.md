# Responsive Event Emitter

Listens to window resize events and trigger proprietary jQuery
 events for Bootstrap responsive thresholds. That is, when the
 window size enters a new responsive zone, such as less than
 768 or greater than 1200, trigger the appropriate event.

 Any custom scripts can attach to these events to trigger
 behavior at these various screen sizes. (e.g., collapse the nav).
