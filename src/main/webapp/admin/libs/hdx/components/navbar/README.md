#Navbar
02/17/2014
Navbar is created from iids-navbar for refactoring and use by iidx,hdx,mdx
 

11/4/13
Navbar historically has been 3 different components: IIDS, HDS, and MDS.
There is an opportunity here to consolidate starting with HDS. The Javascript is no different other than
the addition of responsive. The HDS CSS/LESS can be pulled in to the component as we're just referencing it
from the Design Extension anyway.

As of this time - since the only difference is CSS, we can simply refer to the HDS LESS files in the IIDS-Navbar
