<h3 class="auto-style1"><a name="BSD-3-Clause">The BSD 3-Clause License</a></h3>
<pre><span class="auto-style1">    The following is a BSD 3-Clause ("BSD New" or "BSD Simplified") license</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">template. To generate your own license, change the values of OWNER, ORGANIZATION</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">and YEAR from their original values as given here, and substitute your own.</span><br class="auto-style1"><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">        Note: You may omit clause 3 and still be OSD-conformant. Despite its</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">colloquial name "BSD New", this is not the newest version of the BSD license; it</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">was followed by the even newer BSD-2-Clause version, sometimes known as the</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">"Simplified BSD License". On January 9th, 2008 the OSI Board approved</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">BSD-2-Clause, which is used by FreeBSD and others. It omits the final</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">"no-endorsement" clause and is thus roughly equivalent to the MIT License.</span><br class="auto-style1"><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">        Historical Background: The original license used on BSD Unix had four</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">clauses. The advertising clause (the third of four clauses) required you to</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">acknowledge use of U.C. Berkeley code in your advertising of any product using</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">that code. It was officially rescinded by the Director of the Office of</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Technology Licensing of the University of California on July 22nd, 1999. He</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">states that clause 3 is "hereby deleted in its entirety." The four clause</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">license has not been approved by OSI. The license below does not contain the</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">advertising clause.</span><br class="auto-style1"><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">        This prelude is not part of the license.</span><br class="auto-style1"><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">&lt;OWNER&gt; = Regents of the University of California</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">&lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; = University of California, Berkeley</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">&lt;YEAR&gt; = 1998</span><br class="auto-style1"><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">In the original BSD license, both occurrences of the phrase "COPYRIGHT HOLDERS</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">AND CONTRIBUTORS" in the disclaimer read "REGENTS AND CONTRIBUTORS".</span><br class="auto-style1"><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Here is the license template:</span><br class="auto-style1"><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Copyright (c) &lt;YEAR&gt;, &lt;OWNER&gt; All rights reserved.</span><br class="auto-style1"><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:</span><br class="auto-style1"><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">        Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this</span><br class="auto-style1"><span class="auto-style1">list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
